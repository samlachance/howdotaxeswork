    <p>Let's calculate exactly how much you owe</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10% of $9,225 is <span class="math-total">$922.50</span></li>
      <li>15% of $28,225 is $4,233.75</li>
      <li>25% of $12,550 is $3,137.50</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, you would owe the federal government $8,293.75 before deductions.</p>
