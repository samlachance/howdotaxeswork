      <h2>Great question, guy.</h2>
      <p>Thankfully you've come to the right place. Here in America, we've been too busy being the best country in the universe to worry about tax system approachable. As a result, citizen, many people are unstandably confused about how our federal income tax collection works.</p>
      <p>Worry not, kind citizen. After you get done scrolling through this internet oasis of patriotic awesome, you'll hopefully have a better understanding about how the US government calculates how much we owe.</p>

        <h3>Some things to consider before we get started.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We're going to assume that you are filing as a single person.</li>
          <li>We're not going to account for any deductions.</li>
          <li>This is for America only. Sorry, Canada.</li>

      <h2>What are taxes?</h2>
      <p>Think of our government like your own personal butler. This butler (we'll call him Winston) is responsible for all day to day tasks that are part of your estate's upkeep. Winston is truly a jack of all trades. He cuts the lawn, sweeps the stoop, builds additions, and even keeps trespassers out. If I'm honest, Winston is more of a man then you'll ever be.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, though, nothing in this world comes free (except this glorious website). Since Winston is such a trooper, you are required to pay his wages. In fact, you have no choice but to pay Winston. I mean, sure, you could fire Winston and vote with your family members on another butler, but at the end of the day, you must have a butler to do these tasks. Sure, there are some silly people out there who believe that the butlers are evil and it would be much more effective to do everything on their own but I don't have time to explain all of that. For the purpose of this site you need a butler and that butler has to get paid.</p>
      <p>Out government is our country's butler. It does stuff for us like build roads and fight wars and in return we have to ante up.</p>

      <h2>So what are these tax brackets that everyone talks about?</h2>
      <p>The US uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Basics">graduated tax brackets</a>. This means everyone's income in the US is taxed in chunks. Each chunk has a tax rate. We call these chunks brackets.</p>
      <p>Calculating taxes on this system ensures that each citizen is tax uniformly and fairly. That is to say, everyone pays the same percentage in each bracket. As you begin to make more money, you shift into higher brackets where each <em>new</em> dollar is taxed at a higher rate.</p>
      <p>You might be delighted to know that Donald Trump pays the same amount of money on his first $9,225 as you do. The difference between you and ole Trumpy boy is that he is paying significantly more money on each dollar that he makes over your highest tax bracket. You do probably have better hair, though. So there's that.</p>
      <p>Still in the weeds on this whole tax bracket thing? That's cool. Just keep reading.</p>
